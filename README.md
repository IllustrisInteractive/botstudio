## Components

### Controls
Controls are the building blocks of a bot generated by Bot Studio. It is the programmed response by the bot to an Event or Message. Controls are categorized into three: Simple Controls, Extended Controls, and Dedicated Controls.

#### Simple Controls
Simple Controls are designed for Message oriented I/O. Simple controls take in the **Global Bot Prefix** and a ``command``. The bot can then be programmed to respond by sending a reply or a direct message to the User
